# rock-paper-scissors
This project is a browser-based implementation of the game Rock Paper Scissors. The goal of this is to build my first JavaScript project, from scratch, that will be provided to me by The Odin Project curriculum.

This project will consist of six steps in order for me to finsih the project. Working through this assignment will aid me in problem solving more efficiently - plan or pseudocode my solution, write the code, and test my code to make sure it works.

The initial version of the game is played entirely through the browser console, allowing the user to input their selection (rock, paper, or scissors) and view results directly in the console log. This project serves as an introduction to JavaScript logic, functions, loops, and control flow.

In later stages, the project will be extended to include a graphical user interface (GUI), bringing interactivity through buttons, score displays, and result messages shown directly on the web page.

Skills Demonstrated
- Planning out my initial thoughts on how to tackle the assigment, by problem solving
- Understanding and using functions effectively
- Using conditional statements (if, else if, else) to handle different game outcomes
- Practicing clean code structure and variable naming
- Using loops and function return values to control program flow

(Coming soon - I'll update this after completing the project to review what I learned.)
